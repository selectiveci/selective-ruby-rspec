# Selective RSpec Runner

Selective is an intelligent test runner that shortens the feedback cycle on CI. Tests are evenly distributed across parallel runners by a queue-based system. When available, the PR changeset is used to intelligently order tests such that those likely to fail are run first. Results are streamed to a Dashboard where the combined results from all parallel runners/nodes can be viewed in real time.

Selective is currently in Alpha. If you'd like to try it out, please email alpha@selecive.ci.

## Basic Setup

Selective is easy to set up in your CI environment and requires minimal configuration changes.

While we support all CI providers, there are several listed below that have first-class support. We're adding more providers to the list as we go. Please [let us know](#need-help) what providers you'd like to see next.

If your CI provider is not listed, you can [set the required environment variables](#other-ci-providers) manually.

## Setup Steps

1. Install the gem for your testing framework: `bundle add selective-ruby-rspec`

   > ðŸ’¡ In case of an error Unable to find executable for \<platform\>. Check your `Gemfile.lock` to see if the platform is listed in `PLATFORMS` sections. If not, run `bundle lock --add-platform <platform>`.
   > Currently support platforms:
   >
   > - arm64-darwin
   > - x86_64-darwin
   > - x86_64-linux
   > - aarch64-linux

2. Add your Selective API Key to your CI providerâ€™s secrets
3. Configure Selective in your CI Pipeline. [See below for examples.](#github-actions)
4. Change the rspec command in your CI pipeline from `bundle exec rspec` to `bundle exec selective rspec`. All rspec CLI flags are supported.

```yaml
# GitHub Actions Example
- name: Setup Selective
    uses: selectiveci/setup-selective@v1
    with:
      api-key: ${{ secrets.SELECTIVE_API_KEY }}
      runner-id: ${{ matrix.ci_node_index }}
```

### Mint

[View a full/working example](https://github.com/selectiveci/selective-ruby-rspec/blob/main/.mint/push.yml)

[Create a secret](https://www.rwx.com/docs/mint/secrets) with your API key (`SELECTIVE_API_KEY`). Mint does not require any additional setup.

### CircleCI

[View a full/working example](https://github.com/selectiveci/selective-ruby-rspec/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml)

Ensure you have set an environment variable with your API key (`SELECTIVE_API_KEY`) in your [project](https://circleci.com/docs/set-environment-variable/#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-project) or [context](https://circleci.com/docs/set-environment-variable/#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-context).

```yaml
# CircleCI Orb Example
- setup-selective/init:
    actor: << pipeline.trigger_parameters.github_app.user_username >>
    run_id: << pipeline.id >>
    target_branch: main
```

### Semaphore

[View a full/working example](https://github.com/selectiveci/selective-ruby-rspec/blob/main/.semaphore/semaphore.yml)

[Create a secret](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/essentials/using-secrets/) with your API key (`SELECTIVE_API_KEY`). Semaphore does not require any additional setup.
