# Selective RSpec Runner

Selective is an intelligent test runner built to run in your current CI with a goal of shortening the feedback cycle to the first failure. It does queue-based test splitting using prioritized tests from code changes and time.

## Basic Setup

Our goal for Selective is to make it as easy as possible to setup in your CI environment with minimal changes to your workflows/pipelines.

We have created an Action for GitHub Actions and an Orb for CircleCI to assist with setup. All other CI providers will [require additional setup](#other-ci-providers).

## Setup Steps

1. Install the gem for your testing framework: `bundle add selective-ruby-rspec`

   > ðŸ’¡ In case of an error Unable to find executable for <platform>. Check your `Gemfile.lock` to see if the platform is listed in `PLATFORMS` sections. If not, run `bundle lock --add-platform <platform>`.
   > Currently support platforms:
   >
   > - arm64-darwin
   > - x86_64-darwin
   > - x86_64-linux
   > - aarch64-linux

2. Add your Selective API Key to your CI providerâ€™s secrets
3. Configure Selective in your CI Pipeline. [See below for examples.](#github-actions)
4. Change the rspec command in your CI pipeline from `bundle exec rspec` to `bundle exec selective rspec`. All rspec CLI flags are supported.

### Github Actions

```yaml
# GitHub Actions Example
- name: Setup Selective
    uses: selectiveci/setup-selective@v1
    with:
      api-key: ${{ secrets.SELECTIVE_API_KEY }}
      runner-id: ${{ matrix.ci_node_index }}
```

### CircleCI

```yaml
# CircleCI Orb Example
- setup-selective/init:
    actor: << pipeline.trigger_parameters.github_app.user_username >>
    run_id: << pipeline.id >>
    target_branch: main
```

### Other CI Providers

Selective supports all CI providers. If your provider is not in the list above, set the following environment variables:
